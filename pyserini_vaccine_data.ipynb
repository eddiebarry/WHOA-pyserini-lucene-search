My doctor advised me to get Rubella Vaccine before I plan to get pregnant. Where can I go to get Rubella Vaccine for free of cost in Surrey BC.\nThe rubella vaccine is combined with the measles and mumps vaccine (the MMR vaccine).  You can get the MMR vaccine for free from your local public health unit.  Some pharmacies will also have the free vaccine. Women should avoid becoming pregnant for 1 month after getting the MMR vaccine. \n- Immunization Nurse\n\n 3 what vaccines are safe for me if i am pregnant ? \n 5.81710 I am pregnant and my doctor told me that there is a free pertussis vaccine available, but I don't know where to get it for free. Can I get this through my health unit?\nCanada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization recommends tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis (Tdap) vaccine for pregnant women.  Ideally, this vaccine should be received between 27 and 32 weeks of gestation. This dose is not routinely provided for free in B.C. However, individuals born in 1989 or later who missed their adolescent Tdap booster are eligible for 1 dose of Tdap.  Please call your local health unit and ask to speak to a public health nurse about this. For more information about other vaccines that may be recommended during pregnancy check here.\nImmunization Nurse\n\n 4 what vaccines are safe for me if i am pregnant ? \n 5.59710 Can a pregnant woman get a tetanus shot? What is the cost?\nInactivated vaccines are generally safe in pregnancy. Tetanus is an inactivated vaccine. If a pregnant woman is due for a tetanus shot, there is no cost. The tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis (Tdap) vaccine may be recommended for pregnant women at 26 weeks of pregnancy or later who have not received a dose of pertussis-containing vaccine in adulthood. This dose is not routinely provided for free in B.C. Speak to your health care provider about this. Or, you can call your local community health centre/public health unit and ask to speak to a public health nurse. You can find the number here. You can also find more information about vaccines and pregnancy here.\nImmunization Nurse\n\n 5 what vaccines are safe for me if i am pregnant ? \n 5.47470 I was offered the TDaP by my OB (I'm pregnant) and together we looked up the insert for Adacel (Cdn brand of TDaP) and saw it listed as Pregnancy Category C. Why should I accept the vaccine if the manufacturer itself seems its safety questionable for my baby?\nUnfortunately, we don't know the exact package insert you read and cannot comment regarding the manufacturer's document. However, inactivated vaccines, such as Tdap (Adacel), are generally considered safe in pregnancy.\n\tA number of studies in recent years have shown that the Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis) vaccine is safe when given in pregnancy and is effective in preventing whooping cough (pertussis) in newborns. After careful review of these studies, Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization recommended that all pregnant women get the pertussis vaccine to help protect the baby after birth. The Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada also recommends that all pregnant women get the pertussis vaccine.\n\tThe pertussis vaccine is recommended for pregnant women in many countries, including the U.S, Australia, and New Zealand.\nYou can find more information on vaccines and pregnancy here.\n\t \n \n\n"

The virus that causes chickenpox (the varicella zoster virus) is a virus of the herpes family but is not the same virus that causes cold sores (cold sores are caused by another virus of the herpes family, the herpes simplex virus). If a child has had cold sores, it is still recommended that they get the chickenpox (varicella) vaccine.\nIt is not necessary for people who have had chickenpox or shingles at 1 year of age or older to get the chickenpox vaccine.\nIf this does not answer your question, please clarify and resubmit your question.  You can also contact your local public health unit and ask to speak with a public health nurse. You can find the contact information for your local public health unit here. \n\n 2  My child has caught a cold. Should we vaccinate ?  \n 6.17410 Hello my daughter has a 18 month immunization tomorrow she taking antibiotics it's ok to do the vaccine\nChildren can usually get vaccinated if they have a mild common illness like a cold, ear infection, or diarrhea.  Mild common illnesses do not interference with the immune response to vaccines and do not increase the risk of adverse events following immunization.  Children taking antibiotics can also receive vaccines as antibiotics do not interfere with the immune response to the vaccine.  If you have questions about whether or not your child should be vaccinated, we recommend that you to speak with your immunizing health care provider.\nImmunization Nurse\n \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n 1  My child is sick. Should we continue with the vaccination schedule ? \n 5.20190 My sister-in-law decided not to vaccinate their newborn baby, I work in critical care health and worry that I could make the child sick. What should I do?\nOne of the best things you can do is make sure your vaccinations are up-to-date. This will help prevent you from getting a vaccine-preventable disease and spreading it to the child. You can find a list of vaccines recommended for adults here. It is also important to take general precautions to prevent the spread of disease, such as good handwashing and avoiding contact with others when sick. \nStories about the impact of vaccine-preventable diseases can sometimes help parents better understand the seriousness of these diseases and why vaccines are so important. Voices for Vaccines is a parent-driven organization out of the U.S where parents share their stories about why they have chosen to vaccinate. \nImmunization Nurse \n\n 2  My child is sick. Should we continue with the vaccination schedule ? \n 4.78090 My child was fully immunised overseas and has not had INFANRIX HEXA at 18mths (not offered), my child is now 2. Do we need it or should we wait till 4ys old?\nWe recommend that you contact your local public health unit and ask to speak with a public health nurse.  A public health nurse can review your child's immunization record, recommend and provide any missing vaccines, and ensure your child is up-to-date as per the recommended BC immunization schedule.  You can find the contact information for your local public health unit here.  \n- Immunization Nurse\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n********************************************************************************\n 1 I don't remember if I was vaccinated for hep a and b ?  \n 8.65730 Hi- I don't remember if I was vaccinated for hep a and b?
